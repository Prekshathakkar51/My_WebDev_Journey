        <h3>About Preksha:</h3>
        <p>Her Amazonian figure sat well on her wafer-thin body. She had a decanter shaped waist and her complexion had an impeccable, ochrous hue. Her pencil-thin <u> eyebrows eased down gently to her black</u>, beetle’s-leg eyelashes. A sculptor could not have fashioned her seraph’s ears and pixie’s nose any better.
            When she broke into a smile, her beguiling, oyster-white teeth lit up the room. It could jolt you like an electric current when that megawatt smile gave you her full attention. Filed to perfection, her Venus-red fingernails ran through her nougat-brown hair. Spools of it plunged around her photogenic face and hid a swan’s neck, elegant and <small>I loved her nebulous,</small>  Eden-green eyes which were a-sparkle with the ‘joie de vivre’. <big>They were like two beryl-green jewels melted onto snow.</big>
            Her calamine-pink lips tasted like rose petals. It surprised me that they were plump and botox-boosted as she had a demure, timorous personality. She whispered to me in a dulcet voice as sweet as any songbird. <b> Her voguish clothes still kept captive an aroma redolent of cinnamon and meadow-fresh mint.</b>It lingered in the <i>long after she had</i>room  gone.</p>
